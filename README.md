# Bootstrap workshop at Deree College

Starting code to help students get started at the Bootstrap workshop at Deree College.

## Concept

In this workshop we assume that we are a freelancer web developer that would like to create a modern personal web site in ridiculously little time. For this reason we decided to leave most of the styling duties to bootstrap and deal mostly with the content of our web page, in order to address the needs of our visitors.

## Getting started

Start working instantly based on this code by visiting https://www.sourcelair.com/blueprints/paris/deree-bootstrap-workshop and clicking on **Create project** or **Sign up**, in case you do not have a SourceLair account.

## Flow

1. Declare the basic building blocks of the website (navigation, top content, detailed content, footer)
2. Fill each building block with the proper content
3. Introduce additional styling to our web page
